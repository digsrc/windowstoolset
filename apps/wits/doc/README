What is WiTS
------------

Windows Inspection Tool Set slices a running Windows system
multiple ways, providing cross-linked, filtered views of
Windows components.

  * View properties of processes, network connections,
    users, services and more in customizable tables
  * Navigate between objects via richly cross-linked views
  * Filter displayed items with flexible user defined filters
  * Focus on changing data with enhanced change display modes
  * Customize displayed information and layouts to focus on
    areas of interest.
  * Track and monitor resources and system activity such as
    process startup, network connections, logins and more with
    optional recording to disk
  * Filter and search for Windows events through an integrated view
    of Windows event logs
  * Quickly access functions via the taskbar and hotkeys
