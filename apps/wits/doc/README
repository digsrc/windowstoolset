What is WiTS
------------

Windows Inspection Tool Set slices a running Windows system
multiple ways, providing cross-linked, filtered views of
Windows components.

  * View properties of processes, network connections,
    users, services and more in customizable tables

  * Navigate between objects via richly cross-linked views

  * Filter displayed items with flexible user defined filters

  * Focus on changing data with enhanced change display modes

  * Customize displayed information and layouts to focus on
    areas of interest.

  * Track and monitor resources and system activity such as
    process startup, network connections, logins and more with
    optional recording to disk

  * Filter and search for Windows events through an integrated view
    of Windows event logs

  * Quickly access functions via the taskbar and hotkeys


WiTS started out as a demo for TWAPI (http://twapi.sf.net) 
but is now an independent project on sourceforge.
