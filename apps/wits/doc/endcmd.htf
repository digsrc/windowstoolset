<h1><span class='cmd'>end</span> internal command</h1>
<p>
The <span class='cmd'>end</span> command takes the following form:
</p>
<div class='cmdblock'>
  end OBJECTNAME [OBJECTTYPE]
</div>
<p>
  The command terminates Windows services or processes 
  <span class='cmd'>OBJECTNAME</span>.
  If <span class='cmd'>OBJECTTYPE</span> is specified, only
  objects of that type are matched.
  <span class='cmd'>OBJECTTYPE</span> may be one of
  <span class='cmd'>service</span> or <span class='cmd'>process</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise, the command searches
  for object types in the following order:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows services</li>
  <li>Processes</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All matching objects of a specific type are terminated.
  However, no attempt is made at matching against further object
  types.
</p>
<p>
  In all cases, the object space is searched using multiple match criteria.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    For services, <span class='cmd'>OBJECTNAME</span> is
    matched against the internal and display service names. A
    stop command is sent to the matching service.
  </li>
  <li>
    For processes, <span class='cmd'>OBJECTNAME</span> is
    matched against the process id, path, name (with and without
    file name extension), or the title of toplevel windows.
    All matching processes are terminated.
  </li>
</ul>
