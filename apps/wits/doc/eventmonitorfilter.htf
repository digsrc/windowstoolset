<h1>Filtering events</h1>

<p>
  Several different categories of events can be monitored by the event
  monitor.
  Monitoring of each category can be enabled and disabled through the
  <span class="witsmenu">Event Monitor</span> tab in
  the WiTS preferences dialog shown below. When WiTS
  is installed, only a subset of the categories are enabled by default.
  Only the events matching the filters are displayed in the event monitor
  and written to the log file.

<ul>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">System resources</span> category
    enables monitoring of system resources and will log an event
    when system resources drop below a certain limit. The system
    resources being monitored include per process and system wide
    thread and handle counts. The thresholds at which system
    resources are considered to be low can be set through the
    <a href="eventmonitorpreferences.html">Event Monitor</a> page in
    the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> dialog.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Disk space</span> category
    enables monitoring of low disk space conditions on the system.
    The thresholds at which disk space is
    considered to be low can be set through the
    <a href="eventmonitorpreferences.html">Event Monitor</a> page in
    the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> dialog.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Process starts and exits</span>
    category includes events related to starting of new
    processes. The process id, the program name and the parent
    process are logged.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Network connections</span> category
    includes all new TCP connections and creation of new TCP and UDP
    sockets. Termination of connections is not logged to reduce
    amount of logged messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Driver loads and unloads</span>
    category enables logging of events pertaining to dynamic
    loading and unloading of drivers into the operating system
    kernel.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Windows services</span> category
    enables monitoring of starting and stopping of Windows services.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Network shares</span> category
    logs connections to local and remote network shares. Note this
    capability is not available on Windows 2000.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Logon sessions</span> category
    enables monitoring of the creation and deletion of new logon
    sessions including new users logging on and remote sessions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Windows event log</span> category
    enables monitoring of the Windows event log. Any events logged
    there are also shown in the WiTS event log. Note that
    sometimes can result in duplicate events - one when WiTS
    detects an event itself and a second when the application itself
    writes an event to the Windows event log. An example of this
    is startup or shutdown of a Windows service.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <span class="witsmenu">Thresholds</span> frame controls
  the thresholds for various system resources. When any of these
  thresholds is crossed, an appropriate event is logged. These
  thresholds should be tuned as appropriate depending on system
  resources and load.
