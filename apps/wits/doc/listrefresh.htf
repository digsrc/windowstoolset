<h1>Refreshing list views</h1>
<p>
List views are refreshed automatically by default. Change the refresh
properties through the refresh controls in the list view status bar
as shown below.

</p>
<p>
The interval between refreshes is set rate by editing the
<span class='witsmenu'>Refresh interval (s)'</span> edit box.
This interval is common to all views that show a specific object type.
Changes in the value in a window showing processes will also be 
reflected in all other windows showing processes.
</p>
<p>
You can prevent a window from refreshing by selecting the
<span class='witsmenu'>Freeze</span> checkbox. Note that this will
only prevent that particular window from updating. Other windows, even of
the same object type, will continue to update.
</p>
<p>
The <span class='witsmenu'>Refresh now</span> button will do an immediate
refresh of the displayed data. You can select the
<span class='witsmenu'>Freeze</span> checkbox and use the 
<span class='witsmenu'>Refresh now</span> button to manually control
exactly when the display is refreshed.
