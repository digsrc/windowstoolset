<h1>Running user commands</h1>
<p>
  The <span class="witsmenu">Command</span>
  entry window in the main WiTS window
  allows entry of commands and has a dropdown list box
  that allows selection of previously entered commands.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="usercmd.png" alt="User command field"/>
</p>

<p>
  The command is executed either when the <span class="witsmenu">Return</span>
  key is entered or the <span class="witsmenu">Run</span>
  button is clicked.
</p>
<p>
  The command may be either an internal WiTS command or the name of
  an external Windows program. The command is parsed in standard
  Windows fashion (<em>not</em> using Tcl syntax) and arguments
  with spaces and special characters must be quoted as required
  by Windows.
</p>
<h2>WiTS internal commands</h2>
<p>
  WiTS internal commands are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="showcmd.html">show</a> shows the
    <a href="pageview.html">property page view</a>
    for an object
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="listcmd.html">list</a> shows a
    <a href="listview.html">list view</a> containing
    matching objects
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="endcmd.html">end</a> stops or terminates running objects
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Many WiTS internal commands like
  <a href='listcmd.html'>list</a> and
  <a href='endcmd.html'>end</a> operate on multiple types of
  objects and will attempt to guess the object type if it is not
  specified. For example, the command
  <br /><span class='cmdblock'>list www.yahoo.com</span><br />
  will show a list view containing all connections to
  www.yahoo.com.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, the commands will attempt to match objects in
  multiple ways. For example,
  <br /><span class='cmdblock'>end rpcss</span><br />
  will stop a Windows service matching against both internal
  and display names.
</p>
<p>
  The matching modes for each command are described in the
  documentation for the command.
</p>

<h2>Running external programs</h2>
<p>
  If the entered command does not match one of the internal
  commands listed above, WiTS will assume it is an external
  command. This behaviour is similar to the Windows
  <span class="witsmenu">Run</span>
  dialog box and the command may even be the path to a document
  associated with a program.
