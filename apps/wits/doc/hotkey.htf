<h1>Accessing WiTS using hotkeys</h1>
<p>
  You can configure WiTS with hotkey support for quick
  access to specific views. Hotkeys can be configured through the
  <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> dialog shown below.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Currently hotkeys can be assigned to four views - the main
  WiTS window, the event monitor,
  the process list view and the network connection
  list view.
</p>
<p>
  You can also configure a hotkey to toggle between hiding and restoring
  all opened WiTS views.
