<h1>Using the list view selection </h1>
<p>A row in the table can be selected by clicking on it or navigating
  using the keyboard arrow keys. The selection can
  be extended by holding down the shift key while clicking or
  dragging the mouse, or when using the arrow keys. 
</p>
<p>
  When a single item is selected, additional information about the
  object is displayed in the <span class='witsmenu'>Summary</span>
  pane if it is visible.
</p>
<p>
  When one or more items are selected, actions can be invoked on them
  via either the pop-up menu or the toolbar. For example, in the
  processes list view, all selected processes can be terminated.
