<h1>Mouse and keyboard bindings</h1>
<p>
  The standard Windows mechanisms can be used to navigate within the
  list view. For example, a left-click with the mouse will select a
  row and right click will bring up a pop-up menu.
</p>
<p>
  Standard windows keys can also be 
  used to navigate a list view. The Tab and Shift-Tab keys will cycle
  the keyboard focus through all the control elements of the list
  view. When the table has the focus, the arrow keys may be used to
  move the selection, and PgUp/PgDn keys to page through the table.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the standard key shortcuts, you can also use the keyboard
  to increase (<span class="witsmenu">Ctrl++</span>) or decrease
  (<span class="witsmenu">Ctrl+-</span>) the font in a list view. 
  Restore the default font by typing <span class="witsmenu">Ctrl+0</span>.
