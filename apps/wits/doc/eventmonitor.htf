<h1>Monitoring events</h1>

<p>
  The WiTS event monitor window displays various system events such as
  process starts and exit, new network connections, logon session changes
  and more. A sample monitor display output is shown below.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Events are displayed in the event monitor window with a
  timestamp indicating when they were logged. As events are added
  to the end of the scrolling display, they are briefly
  <span style="background:yellow;">highlighted</span>
  to indicate that new events have arrived.
</p>
<p>
  The toolbar in the event monitor window provides the following functions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Save</span>
    button saves the currently displayed events to a file. Note this only
    saves the currently displayed events. Continuous logging of events
    to a file is separate and independent functionality.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Clear</span>
    button discards all event messages and clears the event
    monitor window.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Stop</span> stops the event monitor
    while keeping the window open. When stopped, the button
    changes into a
    <span class="witsmenu">Start</span> that resumes logging
    of events.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Options</span>
    button brings up the
    <a href="eventmonitorpreferences.html">preferences</a>
    page that allows configuration of event monitor settings such as
    number of events to display.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Filters</span>
    button brings up the
    <a href="eventmonitorpreferences.html">preferences</a>
    page that allows selection of which events are displayed in the event
    monitor.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Keep on top</span> checkbox, if
    enabled, keeps the event monitor on top of other windows
    at all times so that it is always visible.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class="witsmenu">Enable autoscroll</span> checkbox
    controls automatic scrolling of the event monitor window as
    new events are added. Normally, the display
    scrolls up as new event messages are added. This behaviour can
    be distracting when you have scrolled up to look at previous
    events and new events arrive. This checkbox allows this
    behaviour to be turned off.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In all cases, the event monitor
  is always shown at the same location and size as its last
  invocation.
</p>

<p>
  Wherever relevant, data logged in each event is linked to the
  corresponding object. For example, an event for a process starting up is
  linked to the properties page view for that process.
