<h1>Object cross-linking and navigation</h1>
<p>
  All WiTS views, list and property pages as well as the event monitor,
  are linked where appropriate so that it
  is easy to navigate between views of related objects.
</p>
<p>
  An example of this linking is displayed below. The event monitor shows a new
  connection from the Firefox browser. Clicking on the process name
  link in the event
  will bring up the property page for the Firefox process including
  the user account under which the process is running. Clicking in
  turn on the user account link will show the details of the user account.

  This cross-linking of objects makes it very easy to navigate between
  objects and explore a running Windows system for
  troubleshooting or investigative purposes.
