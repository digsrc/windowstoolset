<h1>Highlighting changed data in a list view</h1>
<p>
  Often, all items in a list view are of interest to the user.
  However, on many occasions the user primary focus is on items
  whose properties are changing and in some cases, <em>only</em> those
  items are of interest.
</p>
<p>
  You can choose an appropriate WiTS display mode to suit any of the
  above circumstances via the drop down menu in the status bar of 
  a WiTS list view shown below.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  You can choose one of the following display modes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select <span class="witsmenu">No highlighting</span> to show
    all items present in the last refresh without any
    highlighting.</li>
  <li>Select <span class="witsmenu">Highlight changes</span> to show
    all items present in the last refresh with new items shown in
    green and items whose properties have changed shown in yellow. In
    addition, items which were present in the previous refresh but
    are no longer present are also shown (in red). Items that are
    unchanged from the previous refresh are shown without any color
    coding.</li>
  <li>Select <span class="witsmenu">Changes only</span> to show only
    items that have been added, modified or deleted color-coded as
    above. Unchanged items are not displayed at all.</li>
</ul>
